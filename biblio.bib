  abstract = {This paper describes a new embedded system based on CAN bus protocol
	for remote monitoring and controlling of lighting networks, where
	the network nodes are lighting lamps and environment sensors. The
	main characteristic of the embedded system is its non-master capability,
	allowing interesting applications such as: light dimming control
	of a single lamp, or a group one, through one lighting network node
	having an environment sensor. The embedded system was implemented
	in a small prototype lighting network based on CAN 2.0A with three
	28 Watts fluorescent T5 lamps, one 13.86 Watts HBLED lamp composed
	of six LEDs, and two environment sensors. A lighting system software
	was proposed to perform defined network functions featured through
	one specific CAN node. The proposal can be expanded to a total number
	of 2048 nodes and other kind of lighting lamps can be used. Tests
	were made for defined network functions: individual and group control
	for dimming and turning on/off, fault detection condition of lamp
	tubes and environment sensors monitoring. According to obtained results
	the proposed system performed the established functions successfully
	allowing the implementation of a novel fully functional CAN bus lighting
	network with a reliable two wire remote control. Applications for
	this CAN bus lighting network include building management or studio
	lighting where it is desired to control lamps for saving energy consumption,
	performing lamp maintenance or creating precision lighting effects.},
