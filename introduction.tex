\chapter{Introduction}

This document is the result of six months of work at \acs{CERN}, within the \acs{FELIX} project, in the context of the hardware and software upgrades for the \acl{HL-LHC} era.

\section{Motivation}

Modern \acl{HEP} experiments, such as those conducted at \acf{CERN}, produce massive quantities of data, necessitating \acf{DAQ} systems capable of high throughput, high scalability, and low latency. As the \acf{LHC} transitions to its High-Luminosity phase \acs{HL-LHC}, the demands on \acs{DAQ} infrastructure have increased, creating the need for new hardware and software solutions. This thesis addresses these challenges by focusing on the readout part inside a \acl{DAQ} system, specifically, the \acs{FELIX} platform and the network library \texttt{netio3}.

\section{Context}

The \acs{HL-LHC} will deliver a tenfold increase in integrated luminosity\footnote{A measure of the collected data size, defined as the time integral of the instantaneous luminosity, typically expressed in inverse femtobarns (fb\(^{-1}\)).}, and will increase pile-up to as many as 200 collisions per bunch crossing (compared with about 50 today)\footnote{Instantaneous luminosity is the measure of the number of potential collisions per surface unit (or cross section) over a given period of time.} \cite{HighLumiLHC}. This will require new hardware and software solutions to handle over 150 TB/s of data, generated by proton-proton collisions at a rate of 40 million events per second.

Inside the \acl{T-DAQ} infrastructure of the \acs{ATLAS} experiment is the \acs{FELIX} platform, a data router that connects detector electronics with data processing systems by converting detector-specific data transmission protocols into a standard network protocol.
\texttt{netio3} is the network library that powers the networking of the \acs{FELIX} project.\\
The \acs{FELIX} platform itself is divided in three main components: the hardware, the firmware and the software. The hardware consists of a \acs{PCIe} card installed in a server. The firmware runs on a \acs{FPGA} on the card and is responsible for the data acquisition and processing. The software provides an interface for users to interact with the system.

\section{Objectives}

The primary objective of this thesis is to contribute to the development of new features of the \acs{FELIX} readout system, the enhancement and optimization of existing ones, the testing and assembly of the hardware, and a performance evaluation of the \acs{FELIX} platform ensuring it meets the new requirements.
New features include a way to send configuration data to frontend electronics and a monitoring system.
