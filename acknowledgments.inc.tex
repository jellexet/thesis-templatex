\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First, I am thankful to my wife, \texttt{Natalie}, for her love, patience and support, that makes me feel like the Super Mario of the proposal, that can overcome anything, even a "buggy" Bowser. Nothing expands deeper than the ocean, faster than space, and inexorably like time, other than my love for you.\\
Thanks to my brother, Ibrahim, to whom, as the older brother, I hope to be a good example; he is always there for me, like a construction site for an old man.
Thanks to my friends and colleagues Carlo and Jonas, for their help in writing the thesis, for making every problem look solvable, but especially for making every day a little bit lighter and more fun. 
Thanks to Simone who is able to find a place to sit for lunch. Without you I would be hungry every day.\\
In general thanks to all my colleagues at CERN, it is a pleasure and an honor to work with you all.\\
Thanks to my supervisor, Professor Tullio Facchinetti, for his guidance and feedback on the thesis.\\
I would like to give an honorable mention to Professor Marco Porta, who supervised a previous thesis project that, although never completed, I still remember fondly and still talk about the driving on racing track. For the same reason my thanks go to Cristiano Resta and Gianfranco Rotondo from GuidaSicura Quattroruote.\\
To all my friends and family, who have studied with me or have supported me in my studies and career, I am grateful for your encouragement and belief.\\
